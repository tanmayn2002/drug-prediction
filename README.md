Overview
This repository contains the code for a drug prediction project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
The goal of this project is to predict the potential drugs that may be associated with a given medical condition or set of symptoms based on textual data, such as medical literature, 
clinical trial reports, or patient records.

Project Structure
data/: Directory containing dataset files or links to dataset sources.
models/: Directory to store trained machine learning models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Source code directory containing scripts/modules for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
How to Use
Setup Environment: Install the necessary dependencies by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation: Place your dataset files in the data/ directory. If necessary, preprocess the data using scripts provided in src/preprocessing/.

Model Training: Train the NLP model using the provided notebooks in notebooks/ or by running scripts in src/models/.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation scripts in src/evaluation/.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, use it for drug prediction on new textual data. This can be done using scripts in src/prediction/ or by integrating the trained model into your own application.

Notebooks
01_Data_Exploration.ipynb: Notebook for exploring the dataset and understanding the data distribution.
02_Model_Development.ipynb: Notebook for developing and training the NLP model.
03_Model_Evaluation.ipynb: Notebook for evaluating the performance of the trained model.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
from src.prediction.predictor import DrugPredictor

# Load the trained model
model = DrugPredictor(model_path='models/nlp_model.pkl')

# Predict drugs for a given medical condition
condition = "migraine"
predicted_drugs = model.predict(condition)
print("Predicted drugs for {}: {}".format(condition, predicted_drugs))
